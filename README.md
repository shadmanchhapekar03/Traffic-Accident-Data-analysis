# Traffic-Accident-Data-analysis
Traffic Accident Analysis repository that explores correlations between road conditions, weather, and time of day to improve road safety insights
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data, with a focus on identifying key correlations between road conditions, weather, and the time of day. The project aims to provide insights into accident trends to improve road safety measures and decision-making processes for urban planning.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: To ensure accurate analysis, the dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical techniques are used to understand patterns in accident data.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying key correlations between accident frequency and factors like weather conditions (rain, snow, fog), road types (highways, urban roads), and time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
Time-based Analysis: Categorization of accidents based on the time of day, highlighting peak hours and high-riskÂ periods.
